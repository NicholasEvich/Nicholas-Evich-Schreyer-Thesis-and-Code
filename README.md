# Thesis Source Code

Here you will find source code in both MATLAB and C++ used to conduct my undergraduate honors thesis research at Penn State.
Note that the C++ code is meant to run on a Linux environment, and will therefore utilize some libraries (such as sys/time.h)
that are not available elsewhere.
